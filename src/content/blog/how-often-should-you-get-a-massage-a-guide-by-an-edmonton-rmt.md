One of the most common questions clients ask is: *“How often should I get a massage?”*  
The answer depends on your lifestyle, your goals, and how your body responds to treatment.

Massage therapy is not only for pain relief—it can also play an important role in maintaining overall physical and mental well-being.

## **Why Massage Frequency Matters**

Massage therapy works best when it’s consistent. While one session can provide temporary relief, regular massage helps prevent tension from building up over time.

From a technical perspective, massage supports muscle health, circulation, and nervous system regulation.  
In simple terms, regular massage helps your body stay relaxed, mobile, and balanced.

---

## **How Often Should You Get Massage for Stress Relief?**

If your main goal is relaxation and stress management, massage does not need to be frequent.

**Recommended frequency:**
- Every 4–6 weeks

This schedule helps reduce stress-related muscle tension and supports mental well-being without overwhelming your body.

---

## **How Often Should You Get Massage for Muscle Tension or Stiffness?**

If you experience regular tightness in areas like the neck, shoulders, or back, more frequent sessions may be helpful.

**Recommended frequency:**
- Every 2–3 weeks

This allows your RMT to gradually reduce tension and improve mobility while giving your body time to adapt between sessions.

---

## **Massage Frequency for Chronic Pain or Ongoing Discomfort**

For long-standing discomfort, massage therapy often works best as part of a structured treatment plan.

**Recommended frequency:**
- As advised by your RMT (often weekly or bi-weekly initially)

As symptoms improve, sessions can be spaced out for maintenance.

---

## **Does Massage Need to Be Painful to Work?**

No. Massage therapy does not need to be painful to be effective.

Pressure is always adjusted based on your comfort, treatment goals, and how your body responds. Many clients find consistent, moderate-pressure massage more effective than occasional intense sessions.

---

## **How Lifestyle Affects Massage Frequency**

Your ideal massage schedule may depend on factors such as:

- Desk-based or physical work  
- Stress levels  
- Physical activity or exercise habits  
- Cold weather affecting muscle stiffness  
- Previous injuries  

Many Edmonton clients benefit from adjusting massage frequency during colder months when muscles tend to feel tighter.

---

## **Can Massage Therapy Be Preventative?**

Yes. Many people use massage therapy as preventative care.

Regular massage can help:
- Reduce the risk of muscle strain  
- Improve posture and movement  
- Manage stress before it becomes chronic  
- Support long-term physical health  

Preventative care often requires less intense treatment over time.

## **Direct Billing Available for Massage Therapy**

Massage therapy is commonly covered by extended health insurance plans.

---

## **Choosing the Right Massage Plan for You**

There is no universal schedule that works for everyone. A Registered Massage Therapist can assess your needs and recommend a frequency that supports your goals without over-treating.

Listening to your body and maintaining consistency often leads to the best results.
