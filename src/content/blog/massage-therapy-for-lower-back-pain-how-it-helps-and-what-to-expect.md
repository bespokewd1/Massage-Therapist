Lower back pain is one of the most common reasons people seek massage therapy in Edmonton. Whether caused by long hours of sitting, physical work, stress, or cold weather, lower back discomfort can affect daily movement, sleep, and overall quality of life.

Massage therapy offers a natural and effective way to manage lower back pain while supporting long-term muscle health.

## **Common Causes of Lower Back Pain**

Lower back pain can develop for many reasons, including:

- Prolonged sitting or desk work  
- Poor posture or ergonomics  
- Repetitive movements or heavy lifting  
- Muscle imbalances  
- Stress-related muscle tension  
- Cold weather causing muscle stiffness  

In many cases, pain develops gradually as muscles tighten and movement becomes restricted.

## **How Massage Therapy Helps Lower Back Pain**

From a technical perspective, massage therapy works on muscles, fascia, and surrounding soft tissues to reduce tension and improve circulation.

In simple terms, massage helps tight muscles relax, allowing them to move and function more comfortably.

Massage therapy can help by:

- Reducing muscle tightness and stiffness  
- Improving blood flow to affected areas  
- Supporting better mobility and flexibility  
- Decreasing stress-related tension  
- Promoting overall relaxation

## **What Type of Massage Is Best for Lower Back Pain?**

There is no one-size-fits-all approach. A Registered Massage Therapist will choose techniques based on your condition and comfort level.

Treatment may include:

- Therapeutic massage  
- Deep tissue techniques (when appropriate)  
- Gentle mobilization of surrounding muscles  
- Relaxation-focused techniques  

Massage does not need to be painful to be effective. Pressure is always adjusted to your comfort level.

## **What to Expect During a Lower Back Massage Session**

Your session begins with a brief discussion about your symptoms, daily activities, and goals.

During the massage, your RMT may:

- Focus on the lower back and surrounding areas  
- Work on hips, glutes, and legs to support the back  
- Adjust pressure throughout the session  
- Provide a calm and supportive environment  

Each session is fully customized to your needs.

## **How Often Should You Get Massage for Lower Back Pain?**

Frequency depends on the severity and nature of your discomfort:

- Mild or occasional pain: every 4–6 weeks  
- Ongoing tension or stiffness: every 2–3 weeks

Consistency often leads to better, longer-lasting results.
