Many Edmonton residents spend hours sitting at a desk, working on a computer, or attending long meetings. While this lifestyle may be necessary, it often leads to muscle tension, poor posture, and stress-related discomfort.

Massage therapy is an effective solution for desk and office workers, helping relieve physical strain while promoting relaxation and overall wellness.

## **Common Issues for Desk Workers**

Spending long periods at a desk or on a computer can cause:

- Neck and shoulder stiffness  
- Upper and lower back tension  
- Headaches from tight muscles  
- Reduced circulation  
- Poor posture  

These issues are not just uncomfortable—they can impact productivity, focus, and overall health if left unaddressed.

## **How Massage Therapy Helps Desk Workers**

Massage therapy works on muscles, fascia, and connective tissues to relieve tension and improve mobility.

**Key benefits include:**

- Reducing muscle stiffness in the neck, shoulders, and back  
- Improving posture and alignment  
- Enhancing circulation to tired muscles  
- Reducing stress and mental fatigue  
- Supporting long-term spinal health  

By relaxing muscles and increasing blood flow, massage helps your body recover from the strain of sitting for long periods.

## **Types of Massage for Desk Workers**

Registered Massage Therapists (RMTs) may use a combination of techniques tailored to desk-related strain:

- Therapeutic massage for targeted pain relief  
- Deep tissue massage for chronic tension  
- Relaxation techniques to reduce stress  
- Stretching and mobilization to improve posture  

Your RMT will adjust pressure and techniques based on your comfort and goals.

## **Tips for Desk Workers Between Massage Sessions**

While regular massage helps, small daily habits can make a big difference:

- Take short movement breaks every 30–60 minutes  
- Stretch shoulders, neck, and back periodically  
- Adjust workstation ergonomics  
- Practice deep breathing to reduce tension  

Massage complements these strategies for long-lasting benefits.

## **How Often Should Desk Workers Get Massage?**

Frequency depends on the level of tension and work habits:

- Light tension and stress: every 4–6 weeks  
- Moderate discomfort or chronic tension: every 2–3 weeks  
- Severe or persistent pain: as recommended by your RMT  

Regular, consistent sessions prevent tension from building up and support better posture and comfort.
